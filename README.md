# Project Description

# Data
The data come from several sources. In order to download the data and replicate the analysis you will need your own API keys. The sources I pull from and the code that generates the raw data are:
1. [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/)
    * [Notebook File](code/FredPull.ipynb)
2. [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/)
    * [Notebook File](code/IpumsPull.ipynb)
3. [BEA](https://www.bea.gov/)
